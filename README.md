# MuseumOfCandyV2
Remastered project of Museum of Candy website, created by implementing UX/UI techniques and practices for better user experience and accessibility.

I have implemented UX/UI techniques and practices, making the website more accessible and user-friendly. I changed the background and paragraph text colours to create better contrast and make the website more readable. I have also changed the H1 colours, adding a turquoise accent colour, that is also used in the navbar when hovered, which in my opinion is a nice little detail for the users. 
I have also make some UX research and the feedback was that site would be better if I get rid of additional spacing between images, so I implemented that.
The white icons were not visible anymore, so I switched them with some new colourful ones.
